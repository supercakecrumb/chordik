# Docker Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### âœ… Completed Changes

1. **Updated Dockerfile** (`server/Dockerfile`)
   - Removed complex startup script with seeding logic
   - Updated Go version from 1.25 to 1.23.1
   - Added security improvements (non-root user)
   - Optimized binary size with build flags
   - Clean separation: container only runs API
   - Now builds three binaries: api, seed, and migrate

2. **Updated docker-compose.yml**
   - Added `migrate` service that runs schema migrations as a one-off container
   - Added `seed` service that runs data seeding as a one-off container
   - Proper service dependencies (seed waits for migrate, API waits for seed)
   - Added restart policies for production readiness

3. **Fixed go.mod**
   - Corrected Go version from 1.25 to 1.23

4. **Cleaned up main.go**
   - Removed migration logic from API startup
   - API now only focuses on serving requests

5. **Created dedicated migration tool**
   - Added `cmd/migrate/main.go` for handling schema migrations separately
   - Clean separation between schema migrations and data seeding

6. **Updated seed.go**
   - Removed migration logic since it's now handled by the dedicated migrate command

### ðŸ”„ Current State

Your application now follows Docker best practices with a clean separation of concerns:
- **Build once, deploy many**: Single image contains `api`, `seed`, and `migrate` binaries
- **Separation of concerns**: Schema migrations, data seeding, and API runtime are separate
- **Idempotent seeding**: Your `seed.go` already checks before creating data
- **Production-ready**: Can scale API without re-running migrations

## How to Use the New Setup

### Starting Fresh
```bash
# Remove old containers and data
docker-compose down -v

# Build and start everything
docker-compose up --build
```

### What Happens
1. PostgreSQL starts first
2. `migrate` service runs schema migrations once (creates tables)
3. `seed` service runs data seeding once (creates admin user and sample songs)
4. Both `migrate` and `seed` exit after completion
5. `api` service starts and serves the API
6. `web` service starts the frontend

### Manual Operations
```bash
# Run migrations manually
docker-compose run --rm migrate

# Run seeding manually
docker-compose run --rm seed

# View migration logs
docker-compose logs migrate

# View seeding logs
docker-compose logs seed

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Production Deployment Examples

### Using Docker
```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t chordik:v1.0.0 ./server

# Run migrations once
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env.prod \
  chordik:v1.0.0 /app/migrate

# Run seeding once
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env.prod \
  chordik:v1.0.0 /app/seed

# Deploy API (can run multiple instances)
docker run -d \
  --name chordik-api \
  --env-file .env.prod \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  chordik:v1.0.0 /app/api
```

### Using Kubernetes
The setup is ready for Kubernetes with:
- Migration as a Job (runs once)
- Seeding as a Job (runs once)
- API as a Deployment (scales horizontally)
- No initialization logic in containers

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between setup and runtime
2. **Scalability**: Can run multiple API instances without conflicts
3. **Reliability**: Migrations won't accidentally run multiple times
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to run migrations separately in CI/CD
5. **Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
6. **Efficiency**: Optimized binary size, Alpine base image
7. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes debugging easier

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new setup** to ensure everything works correctly
2. **Consider environment-specific compose files** for different deployments
3. **Add health check endpoint** if not already present (`/api/health`)
4. **Document the deployment process** for your team
5. **Consider implementing versioned migrations** with golang-migrate for production environments

The foundation is now solid and follows industry best practices for containerized Go applications!
